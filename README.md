# Why are you doing this?
Every single tumblr downloader app is bloated as hell and has ads. I wanted to make a FOSS app that would just download stuff without much hassle and without any Google libraries.

# Usage
- Install app
- Click on the share/send button of the video post you want
- On the bottom row where you see all the apps, search for Dash Downloader
- When the link appears in the url bar, click download
- profit

# Requirements
* Android 5 onwards

# Todo
* ~~Some videos can't be downloaded because of the way the html is parsed. I still can't find the goddamn reason, but as soon as I find it I'll update the app.~~ Done!
* ~~Add an icon and make the app prettier overall~~ Done!
* ~~Add option to send directly to app instead of manually copying/pasting url~~ Done!
* ~~Show a notification instead of a toast when a video is downloaded~~ Done!
* Publish in F-Droid, optional Play Store.

# Wtf is up with that name.
Remember when people wanted to make a tumblr convention, and wanted to call it tumblrcon, but Tumblr said they'd sue since Tumblr is copyrighted, so they called it dashcon instead? Yeah.

# License

All MIT license and stuff. I doubt anyone will have the exact specific case use I had but if you're crazy enough to use this piece of crap code, go wild. It's yours. I don't want it, that's why I'm sharing it.
